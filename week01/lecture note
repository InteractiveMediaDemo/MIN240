So, our first project is to think about the best way to fill the wall in the house.
You have an idea that you want to decorate the wall with the frames.

You will start the sketch - Let's say, you would have four rectanglar frames. How would you arrange them?


## concept of div
Today, we will design one-page website: one rectangle in the middle.
